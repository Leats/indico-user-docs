# Indico Room Booking 

This chapter describes the Indico module for booking a room for an event.

Indico users can book a room for their conference, meeting or lecture. Bookings can also be standalone, they do not have to be bound to any event. Room managers can monitor and moderate all bookings. Indico administrators can create rooms and manage their data.

This section is a tutorial, navigating through the pages of the room booking module. It shows you how to assign a room to a particular event or simply to book a room on its own, without attaching it to an event. The booking can then be managed from the administration area.
